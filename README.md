# Advanced Hopper

Adds a filterable hopper to Minecraft.<br/>
With this mod you can filter multiple items. This mod has been inspired by [GoldenHopper](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/GoldenHopper)

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) if it is not installed.
2. Download Golden Hoppers from [GitHub](https://github.com/leniver/AdvancedHopper/releases).
3. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, a iron hopper will be craftable using a hopper and redstone components. This iron hopper has an additional slots to specify a multiple items to filter; when those slots are filled, the hopper will only insert or extract items with the same type as the filter items.

## Multiplayer Server Notes

Thanks to the awesome [Polymer framework](https://polymer.pb4.eu), you can run the mod on your server and player without the mod installed will be able to see the hoppers.<br/>
Advanced hoppers will appear as regular Hoppers on those clients but they will function normally.

In order for this to work, you need to also have the polymer mod installed.<br/>
*(polymer is not required if you don't want this feature)*
